# Flowable - Frontend Exercise 3

## Problem description

Our `Hello` component is becoming more insteresting and now has acquired `State`. We've added a button which we'd like to use to modify the displayed message.

## Tasks

- When the button is clicked the state's message must change to `Hi! I'm a value coming from the component state (UPDATED)`
- When we click the button we'd like also to change the value from `Flowable!` to `Flowable is Awesome!`
